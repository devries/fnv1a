# fnv1a
This is mostly to teach myself about using ctypes to call C functions. It's a simple implementation of the 64-bit
Fowler-Noll-Vo 1-A hash variant (FNV-1a) in C with a ctypes-driven module in python. I picked FNV-1a because I had
already implemented it in C for another project, and because a fast implementation is useful. I am not sure the
overhead that ctypes adds to this call.
